Part 2

1. What are the two types of Intents?
There are implicit intent and explicit intent.


Which of the two types of Intents are more secure?
Explicit intent is more secure, because it can specify the receiving component and implicit
intent will deliver to all components that have registered to receive that action.
So it would be troublesome when you forget to check all components that registered and send
this message to unwanted components.


What type of Intent is shown on lines 69 to 73 of SecondFragment.kt?
It is implicit intent. It is opening a web page.


What type of Intent is shown on lines 68 to 70 of ThirdFragment.kt?
It is explicit intent. It specifies first and second activities.


Which of these two Intents is the proper way to do an Intent?
The ThirdFragment.kt is using the right intent, because you want to open inside
the app not a new window in the browser.

I changed the implicit intent in SecondFragment.kt to be explicit intent. 
Before, SecondFragment.kt is opening a new page in the browser, which is insecure and not right.
Now, I start a new ProductScrollingActivity and use explicity intent to send user information along.
And in ProductScrollingActivity.kt, it makes call to the right api '/api/index'.
